[Nick](https://twitter.com/nicktmro) and [Todd](https://twitter.com/todddeland) met at the Google Developer Group Summit in California. Todd is a GDG Lead in USA, and Nick is GDG Lead in New Zealand. 

Keep in Touch is their Podcast, and it gives the two guys another reason to catch up and have some fun with and about technology.
